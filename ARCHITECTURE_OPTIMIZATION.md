# Eventia Architecture Optimization Plan

## Current Architecture Assessment

The Eventia platform currently uses a split architecture with:
- React/TypeScript frontend with component-based UI
- FastAPI/MongoDB backend with router-based endpoints
- Docker-based deployment

## Recommended Architecture Improvements

### 1. Frontend Architecture Refinement

Implement a clearer 3-layer architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: UI components with no business logic
- **Domain Layer**: Hooks, context providers, and business logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: API clients, storage adapters, and external services
