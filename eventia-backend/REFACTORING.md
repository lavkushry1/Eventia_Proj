# Eventia Backend Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the refactoring of the Eventia Backend application following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern.

## Architecture Overview

### Models
- Represent data structures and database operations
- Encapsulate MongoDB operations and validation logic
- Located in `app/models/`
- Key models: Event, Booking, Payment

### Controllers
- Contain business logic for the application
- Act as intermediaries between models and views
- Located in `app/controllers/`
- Key controllers: EventController, BookingController, PaymentController, AdminController

### Views (API Routes)
- Represent API endpoints using Flask Blueprints
- Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Delegate business logic to controllers
- Located in `app/views/`
- Key routes: event_routes, booking_routes, payment_routes, admin_routes

### Additional Components
- **Database**: MongoDB connection module with connection pooling (`app/db/`)
- **Schemas**: Data validation and serialization using Marshmallow (`app/schemas/`)
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings and constants (`app/config/`)
- **Utilities**: Middleware, logging, metrics, and memory profiling (`app/utils/`)

## Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Business logic separated from route handling
   - Data access separated from business logic
   - Configuration separated from application code

2. **Code Organization**
   - Logically grouped modules by responsibility
   - Clear package structure with proper imports
   - Consistent naming conventions

3. **Database Improvements**
   - Connection pooling for better performance
   - Centralized database access
   - Error handling for connection failures

4. **API Enhancements**
   - Blueprint-based organization
   - Consistent response formatting
   - Schema-based validation

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Memory usage profiling

6. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment-specific configuration classes
   - Constants for string values
   - Externalized configuration via environment variables

## Running the Application

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with Flask development server
python app/main.py
```

### Production
```bash
# Run with Waitress WSGI server (built-in)
python app/main.py

# Run with Gunicorn (if installed)
gunicorn wsgi:app -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:3002
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for models, controllers, and routes
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints
   - Add test fixtures and mocks

2. **Documentation**
   - Add API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Document database schema
   - Add more docstrings to functions and classes

3. **Security**
   - Implement proper authentication with JWT
   - Add rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Input sanitization and validation

4. **Performance**
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement background tasks for long-running operations
